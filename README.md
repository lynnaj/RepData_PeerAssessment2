Peer Assessement 2 : Storm Data

##Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities 
and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing 
such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. 
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and 
where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

##Assignment

about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

##Requirements
For this assignment you will need some specific tools

RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.

knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML
